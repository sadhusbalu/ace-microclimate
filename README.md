# IBM APP CONNECT ENTERPRISE for Microclimate

![ACE Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ot4i/ace-helm/master/appconnect_enterprise_logo.svg?sanitize=true)

## Introduction

IBMÂ® App Connect Enterprise is a market-leading lightweight enterprise integration engine that offers a fast, simple way for systems and applications to communicate with each other. As a result, it can help you achieve business value, reduce IT complexity and save money. IBM App Connect Enterprise supports a range of integration choices, skills and interfaces to optimize the value of existing technology investments.

This container builds a bar file based on the artifacts stored in the `ace-pi` folder, and automatically deploys it to the ACE Server at start up.

A Microclimate instance can be pointed at a clone of this repository, and will build a new container and deploy the helm chart automatically.

## Prerequisites

Can be deployed with or without Microclimate.

## Docker Image

### Building the  base image

The base image can be built using standard [Docker commands](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerimages/) against the Dockerfile supplied here: https://github.com/ot4i/ace-docker

~~~
cd ace-docker-master/11.0.0.0/ace/ubuntu-1604/base
docker build -t ibmcom/ace:11.0.0.0 .
~~~

### Building the image with the automated bar file build and deployment

~~~
docker build -t ace-microclimate:latest  .
~~~

### Running the image

~~~
docker run --name myMicroclimateAce -e LICENSE=accept -P ace-microclimate:latest
~~~

### Push the image to the ICP docker registry
